== Welcome to The YODEL codex
The YODEL codex is a secure API that allows you to automatically place orders 
with YODEL, get labels for your parcels and track their delivery status.

Download the code from github

   git clone git@github.com:Junius/codex.git

Then make sure bundler is installed

   apt-get install bundler

Once bundler is installed it is necessary to install the gems

   bundle install gems

Before creating the database we need to perform some config steps. Namely specify the database connection. 

   cp config/database.ci.yml config/database.yml

The edit the newly created database.yml to include the environment details specific to you

The create the database using rake

   rake db:migrate

Now that the environment is ready, we need to load the gazetteer data. In test mode run the following
   
   script/generate gazetteer

then load the test gazetteer data

bundle exec rake "gazetteer:import[gems/ruby/1.8/gems/yodel_gazetteer-0.0.11/test_data/gazetteer_test_001.zip, gems/ruby/1.8/gems/yodel_gazetteer-0.0.11/test_data/service_exchange_test_001.zip]"

then activate the gazetteer
   rake gazetteer:activate["001"]

Once all that is done the application should be ready to run. 
   script/server

WIN!!!
