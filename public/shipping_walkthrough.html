    <div class="heading">A fictional shipping company</div>
    <p>
        This description of the YODEL codex is from the point of view of the
        fictional shipping compnay, ACME. In this sinario ACME's best customer
        Mr Wile E Coyote wants to buy some dehydrated boulders, so that he can
        catch his favourite prey - road runner. Although YODEL cannot help
        Mr Coyote directly with getting his lunch they can certinaly help ACME
        in sending him the parcels that he so desperatly needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our story starts on the 1st of Feburary 2010 just after breakfast. At
        ACME Geoff in the stores has got into work and has had his cup of coffee
        when the phone rings, guess who is on the line.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
          <div class="heading">Monday 09:10, a phone call from Mr Wile E. Coyote</div>
          <p>
              Wile E. Coyote calls ACME to place his order for 300 dehydrated holes.
              Geoff picks up the phone, he records the sale using his home grown shipping system.
              The dehydrated boulders come in boxes of 100, and Geoff knows that he will
              have to create a consignment consisting of three parcels for Mr Coyote.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <div class="heading">Monday 09:11, Geoff logs into the codex</div>
          <p>
              Geoff logs into his shipping application, which is an internal ACME website.
              His web site offers him a UI which allows him to enter the products he whishes to
              ship to Mr Coyote. In order for Geoff to request a shipment from the YODEL network
              his shipping application must login to the codex.
          </p>
          <p>
              The URL that represents Geoffs account on the codex is <a href="/accounts/acme/users/geoff">codex.yodel.co.uk/accounts/acme/users/geoff</a>.
              This returns Geoffs information in an XML format.
              Geoffs shipping application has a dashboard which shows the most important information to Geoff.
              To get the Geoff's current list of the current set of YODEL orders
              it makes another call to the codex using this API.
              <a href="/accounts/acme/orders">codex.yodel.co.uk/accounts/acme/orders</a>.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <div class="heading">Monday 09:15, Geoff creates a new YODEL order</div>
          <p>
              Geoff wants to creates a new order so he clicks on the New order button.
              This shows a form where Geoff can enter Mr Coyotes information. Geoff
              fills in the order information supplied for Mr Coyote.
              When he is done he hits save.
          </p>
          <p>
              His shipping application then posts the order information to the codex.
              The data for the order is in the POST format and is posted to 
              <a href="/accounts/acme/orders">codex.yodel.co.uk/accounts/acme/orders</a>.
              This is successfull and redirects the response to the following new order, which has now been given an order reference.
              <a href="/orders/272625">codex.yodel.co.uk/orders/272625</a>
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <div class="heading">Monday 09:16, Geoff creates a consignment</div>
          <p>
              There are no consignments in this order yet so Geoff hits a "new consignment" button.
              He is presented with a a form fills for the consignment information. Once this is complete he presses "save" and the form data is posted to
              the yodel codex here  <a href="/accounts/acme/consignments">codex.yodel.co.uk/accounts/acme/consignments</a>
              Again this is successfull and the codex creates a new consignment
              id and redirects the response to the details for the new consignment
              <a href="/accounts/acme/consignments/3456">codex.yodel.co.uk/accounts/acme/consignments/3456</a>
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <div class="heading">Monday 09:30, Geoff uses the comments feature to store extra information</div>
          <p>
              Geoff places alot of orders with yodel and he likes to know what is going where.
              so he changes the description to "Shipment to Mr Cyote 300 invisible holes"
              Notice that Geoff can leave comments on the order these are posted
              to the codex so that they can be shared accross all his systems, and with Yodel.
              He adds the parcels to the consignment by POSTing parcel objects to the codex with the consignment reference
              <a href="/accounts/acme/parcels">codex.yodel.co.uk/accounts/acme/parcels</a>
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <div class="heading">Monday 09:47, Mr Coyote wants notifications of his parcel status so he adds a notification</div>
          <p>
              The order allows Geoff to provide addresses for diferent comunication networks such as email and SMS.
              Geoffs system allows him to post updates  to the order for these.
              <a href="/orders/272625">codex.yodel.co.uk/orders/272625</a>
              Mr Coyote is very hungery and wants to get on with his plan to catch road runner
              so he asks Geoff to notified him by email and SMS.
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <div class="heading">Monday 10:30, My Coyote changes his mind, he only needs 200 dehydrated boulders</div>
          <p>
              Geoff had previously created a consignment o three boxes each with 100 dehydrated boulders in it.
              So all geoff has to do is get rid of one parcel. Geoff changes the description and removes one of the parcels from the consignment.
              His systems acheives this by sending a DELETE request to the address of the parcel in the codex.
              <strong>DELETE</strong> <a href="/parcels/11102236">codex.yodel.co.uk/parcels/11102236</a>, if
              the call is successfull it returns the informtion about the consignment
              and the you will notice the delete in the history.
              <a href="/accounts/acme/consignments/3456">codex.yodel.co.uk/accounts/acme/consignments/3456</a>
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <div class="heading">Monday 10:45, Geoff needs labels for his parcels</div>
          <p>
            When the codex is posted parcel details it automatically attempts 
            to get the pre advice. The codex does not only allow users to
            get information about their parcels it can also generate labels.
            As with any other information, the label can be accessed via the ReST API.
            <a href="/parcels/11102235/label">
                codex.yodel.co.uk/parcels/11102235/label
            </a>
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <div class="heading">Monday midnight the van driver is scheduled for the pickup</div>
          <p>
              The YODEL systems are aware of Geoffs order and they schedule a vandriver to come and pick up the parcels.
              This can be seen in the order status.  
              <a href="/accounts/acme/orders/272625">codex.yodel.co.uk/accounts/acme/orders/272625</a>
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <div class="heading">Tuesday 08:45  A van arrives at ACME</div>
          <p>
              Then the order is collected by driver Mike who has van id 063428. Again this information is stored and is accessible via the order URL
              <a href="/orders/272625">codex.yodel.co.uk/orders/272625</a>
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <div class="heading">Wednesday 10:33  Mr Coyote gets his parcels</div>
          <p>
            Mr Coyote gets notified by email and text, and on wednesday his parcels arrive.
            Geoff can tell the status of the delivery by making a call to the codex looking at the parcels URL.
            <a href="/parcels/11102236">codex.yodel.co.uk/parcels/11102236</a>
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <div class="heading">Wednesday 12:05  Geoffs order status is updated</div>
          When the van driver delivers the parcels to Mr Coyote he scans them.
          When all the parcels are successfully delivered the order status is updated.
          Again Geoff can see this by looking at the order.
          <a href="/orders/272625">codex.yodel.co.uk/orders/272625</a>
      </li>
    </ol>

                                        <p>
                                            We hope that this example shows you the basic operatio of the YODEL codex.
                                            To really get to grips with the codex API take a look at the <a href="codex_api.html">YODEL codex API</a>.
